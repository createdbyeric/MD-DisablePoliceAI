# Information
This lightweight script disables **All** PoliceAI from spawning. This includes all Police AI from walking around the cities, in front of police stations, etc. This also includes police senarios around the map such as parking, traffic stops, etc. Again, this removes all police from FiveM.

# How To Use
1. Download via Github
2. Open Zipped Folder
3. Open 'Disable_PoliceAI-main' folder
4. Drag 'dpai' to your 'resources' folder
5. Add 'start dpai' or 'ensure dpai' (depending server version) to your server.cfg file
6. Start Server

# Support
There is no support for this script as it's a very basic script and offers no customization or speical features. If this script isn't working for you than either you installed it incorrectly or there has been an update to FiveM and how it handles event listeners. If that is the case, please report an issue and we will update the script for all.
